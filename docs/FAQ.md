# FAQ

## Is GINP a shader library?
No. It is a causal control framework.

## Why not just tune bloom/shaders?
Those techniques are widely explored. GINP focuses on system-level decisions: when an effect should exist and when it should stop.

## Does it scale?
The design target is predictable scaling by avoiding meaningless updates and declaring steady state explicitly.
