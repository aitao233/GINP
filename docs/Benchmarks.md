# Benchmarks

## What to measure
- `stat unit` / `stat game` / `stat gpu`
- FPS locked at 60 (if applicable)

## Suggested stress test
- Spawn hundreds of physics-enabled emissive spheres
- Ensure collisions are active
- Observe stability under motion + collision

Record:
- UE version
- hardware
- sphere count
- settings (bloom/on, physics on/off)
